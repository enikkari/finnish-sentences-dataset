This is the finnish sentences dataset distribution v 1.0.0

This project is created to store and track an open source dataset of sentences in the Finnish language

The dataset is based on YLE esuskuntavaalit vaalikone dataset that is available at
https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9526290

The current version has been separated into sentences by periods, question marks and exclamation marks.
This segmentation is lacking and the dataset will be improved in the future.
The dataset also contains occasional sentences in swedish and english.

The sentences are located in file yle-vaalikone-2017.txt
